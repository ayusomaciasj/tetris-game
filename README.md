## Overview

**Project Title**: Tetris game

**Project Description**: This project was to start getting involved into the game frameworks, I use pygame for this opportunity creating a tetris game. The game for the moment just count with the shapes, checks collisions, clear the lines, and rotate the shapes. The goal is to add point, multiplayer edition, add sound, and more details to the game. 
 
**Project Goals**: 
* Create a classic game tetris which can perform the basic functions like rotating, or clearing lines.
* Learn and understand more about frameworks and python which was the language used for this project
* Develop my ability to create new games and more details to them

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Install Python on computer(version 3.8 or later)
2. Install Pygame
3. Install an editor in my case I use Visual Studio Code  
4. Save the content as .py
5. Write the code and run on the arrow on the top of the editor. 

## Development Environment 

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* An intermediate knowlede of Python
* Code editor(Visual Studio Code)
* Functions for the rotation, check_collision, merge_tetrimino, clear lines, and draw board
* shapes of letters (I, O, T, L, J, S, Z)
* Screen dimensions

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* For the future, it is planned to add sound effects
* Add more functions, animations, points earned, and highscores 
* The function to be able to play multiplayer
